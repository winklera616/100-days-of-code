# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: JS: Array Iteration & Humbled by Scope
**WDBC Section:** 12 - Arrays

**Thoughts:** Learned array iteration including forEach - and also realized that scope is super frustrating sometimes. I was having issues with chrome developer tools working and showing the console.log correctly, and I determined it came down to the scope. The forEach section felt way better than when I started this section last week, however.
